          <p class="about-text">
            Unicorns are mythical creatures that have been a part of human
            folklore for centuries. They are typically depicted as a horse with
            a single, spiraling horn on their forehead. Unicorns are often
            associated with purity, innocence, and magic, and are a popular
            subject in art, literature, and media. In popular culture, the
            unicorn is often portrayed as a cute and colorful creature, but in
            traditional mythology, the unicorn was often seen as a powerful and
            majestic animal. It was said to be able to outrun any other creature
            and could only be tamed by a very skilled hunter.
